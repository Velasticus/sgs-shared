/**
 * SGS Protocol constants.
 * <p>
 * A protocol message is constructed as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> (unsigned short) payload length, not including this field
 * <li> (byte) operation code
 * <li> optional content, depending on the operation code.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A {@code ByteArray} is encoded in a context dependent fashion. If the
 * ByteArray is the only content, or if the ByteArray is the last piece of
 * content (that is, if the length of the ByteArray can be determined by the
 * payload length and the length of what has come before), the ByteArray is
 * encoded as
 * <ul>
 * <li> (byte[]) the bytes in the array
 * </ul>
 * If there is other content that follows the ByteArray, then the ByteArray is
 * encoded as
 * <ul>
 * <li> (unsigned short) number of bytes in the array
 * <li> (byte[]) content
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A {@code String} is encoded as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li> (unsigned short) number of bytes of modified UTF-8 encoded String
 * <li> (byte[]) String encoded in modified UTF-8 as described in
 * {@link java.io.DataInput}
 * </ul>
 * Note that these encodings only apply to those data items that are specified
 * explicitly in the protocol. Application data, passed as a ByteArray, may
 * contain any information, but will need to be parsed (and, if necessary,
 * converted to and from a network representation) by the application or client.
 * <p>
 * The total length of a message must not be greater than 65535 bytes; given the
 * header information this means that the payload of a message cannot be greater
 * than 65532 bytes. If a message larger than this must be sent, it is the
 * responsibility of the sender to break the message into pieces and of the
 * receiver to re-assemble those pieces. 
 * <p>
 * Behavior not specified in this document is left as an implementation 
 * decision for the particular client and server. Information on the
 * implementation characteristics of the RedDwarf server can be found
 * in the <a href="../../../../../overview-summary.html"> overview</a> for the 
 * implementation.
